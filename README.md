# FIR FOR THE PULP CV32E40X
Custom Finite Impulse Response (FIR) accelerator in System Verilog designed for integration with the PULP CV32E40X RISC-V core. Performs real-time fixed-point filtering on streaming sensor data using a shift register and a multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit.

*Will later be integrated and tested using [X-Heep](https://github.com/x-heep/x-heep)*
